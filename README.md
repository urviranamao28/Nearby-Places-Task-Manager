Overview:
This is a Task Manager Android Application that helps in reminding the pending tasks using geofencing.

For instance, is a user wants some books and while he/she is out doing other work and he/she happens to pass by a bookstore, when that user comes within a pre-defined distance of the store, this application will send a reminder to the user in the form of a notification.
This application is Speech-to-Text enabled.

Technologies Used:
Java, Google Maps API.

Future Plan of Action:
* If more than one tasks is within a certain range, develop an algorithm to choose minimum time taking path taking into account the traffic,

* Integrate Google Home devices,

* Develop a flutter application for the same in order to be used on iOS devices.
